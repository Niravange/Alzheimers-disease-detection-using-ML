# Alzheimers-disease-detection
I've downloaded the dataset from kaggle.you can find it here @https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images
I've implemented image preprocessing techniques like CLAHE and feed the data to Convolutional Neural network  and RESNET -18 and it gave good accuracy of 99% and 94% respectively

ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE:
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells degenerate and die.
Alzheimer’s is an irreversible disease and it can slowly cause impairment in memory and cognitive function.

WHY DO WE NEED A PREDICTIVE MODEL?
It is a tedious job to diagnose this in its early stage and very expensive as we need a vast volume of data, prediction software and a highly skilled doctor. 
Present Alzheimer's disease(AD) diagnosis is primarily based on cognitive assessment and recording mental deterioration through a series of standardized assessments as well as subjective examination by the clinician. Hence we need a predictive model that ease the treatment.
